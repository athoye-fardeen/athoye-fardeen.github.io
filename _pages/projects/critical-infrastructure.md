## GIS-based Network Analysis of Fire Station Accessibility to Hospitals in Dhaka

### Overview
This project evaluates the efficiency of fire emergency response in Dhaka City Corporation
using GIS-based network analysis. The study focuses on service area delineation, shortest
route identification, and response time assessment between fire stations and hospitals.

### Research Questions
- What are the existing service areas of fire stations?
- What are the shortest possible routes between fire stations and hospitals for efficient emergency response?
- How much time is required for fire stations to reach hospitals using these optimal routes?
- How does the spatial distribution pattern of fire stations influence their service efficiency?

### Network Analysis

**There are only six selected tertiary hospitals and nine fire stations in Dhaka South. Five hospitals fall within the service area of fire stations. In the south, fire stations are closely located while absence of adequate number of fire station is seen in Dhaka North. Only six out of the 23 tertiary hospitals area located within the service area of fire stations.**

**The response time of fire stations in not normally distributed.**
**Mean response time (23.5027 minutes) of fire stations using shortest routes is higher than National Fire Protection Association standard of response time ( 9 minutes 20 seconds)**
