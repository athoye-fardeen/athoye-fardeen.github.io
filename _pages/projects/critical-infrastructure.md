### Overview
This project evaluates the efficiency of fire emergency response in Dhaka using GIS-based network analysis. The study focuses on service area delineation, the shortest
route identification, and response time assessment between fire stations and hospitals.

### Research Questions
- What are the existing service areas of fire stations?
- What are the shortest possible routes between fire stations and hospitals for efficient emergency response?
- How much time is required for fire stations to reach hospitals using these optimal routes?
- How does the spatial distribution pattern of fire stations influence their service efficiency?

### Network Analysis

**There are only six selected tertiary hospitals and nine fire stations in Dhaka South. Five hospitals fall within the service area of fire stations. In the south, fire stations are closely located, while the absence of an adequate number of fire stations is seen in Dhaka North. Only six out of the 23 tertiary hospitals are located within the service area of fire stations.**

Anderson-Darling Test: p-value: 0.03459

CVM Test: p-value: 0.02085

**The response time of fire stations is not normally distributed.**
**Mean response time (23.5027 minutes) of fire stations using shortest routes is higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of response time ( 9 minutes 20 seconds)**
