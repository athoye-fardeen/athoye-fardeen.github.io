title: "Spatial Disparity in the Provision of Public Facilities in Bangladesh"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/spatial-disparity/

### Overview
This project examines spatial concentration and disparity in the distribution of public facilities across 64 regions of Bangladesh. Using quantitative spatial indicators and GIS-based mapping, the study identifies overserved and underserved regions and highlights intra-national inequalities in access to education, healthcare, and economic infrastructure.

### Key Variables
The study focuses on seven key public facilities that influence human development, economic productivity, and regional equity.
- Primary Schools  
- Secondary Schools  
- Colleges  
- Private Hospitals / Clinics  
- Government Health Complexes  
- Growth Centers  
- Rural Markets  

### Spatial Concentration
**Location Quotient (LQ)** was applied to evaluate the per-capita availability of a facility:
- LQ > 1 → Concentration (overserved)
- LQ < 1 → Deficiency (underserved)
- LQ = 1 → Self-sufficient

</em></p> 

- **Northern and southern districts** show higher concentration of educational facilities
- **Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj, Chattogram** show per-capita deficiencies despite absolute facility numbers
- Healthcare facilities exhibit **strong spatial clustering**


### Spatial Disparity
**Gini Coefficient** was used to measure inequality.
- Gini = 0 → Perfect equality  
- Gini = 1 → Total inequality
  
| Facility | Gini Coefficient |
|--------|----------------|
| Government Health Complex | 0.52 |
| Private Hospital / Clinic | 0.35 |
| College | 0.29 |
| Secondary School | 0.24 |
| Primary School | 0.21 |
| Growth Center | 0.23 |
| Rural Market | 0.16 |

**Highest inequality:** Healthcare facilities  
**Lowest inequality:** Rural markets

### Composite Index & Z-score classification  
A **Composite Score** was calculated by aggregating all facilities per 1,000 population. Regions were ranked using **Z-scores** to classify development levels.

| Development Level                          | Z-score Range     | N  | %   |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|----|-----|
| Significantly above the national mean      | Above 1.00        | 14 | 22% |
| Above the national mean                   | 0.00 to 1.00      | 13 | 20% |
| Equal to the national mean                | Equal to 0.00     | 0  | –   |
| Below the national mean                   | -1.00 to 0.00     | 28 | 44% |
| Significantly below the national mean     | Below -1.00       | 9  | 14% |
