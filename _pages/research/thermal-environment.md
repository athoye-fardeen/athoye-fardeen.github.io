### Motivation
Rapid urbanization in Dhaka has intensified surface thermal stress and altered vegetation and water dynamics. Quantifying spatiotemporal variation in land surface temperature (LST) and key spectral indices is essential for understanding urban heat patterns and environmental change.

### Goal
Assessing the spatiotemporal variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)) of Dhaka city between 2018 and 2023 using Landsat 8 satellite imagery.

### Methodological Workflow
- Image filtering by date and cloud cover  
- Cloud masking and radiometric correction  
- Computation of NDVI, NDWI, and MNDWI  
- LST derivation from TIRS bands  
- Annual aggregation and trend analysis
