### Motivation
During the last two decades, heavily industrialized and inadequately planned urban regions of Bangladesh, particularly Dhaka, have experienced degraded air quality. The Global Liveability Index 2018 designated Dhaka as the second least liveable city worldwide because of its severe air pollution. A study on air quality in the world’s most polluted 50 cities found that Dhaka is the second most polluted city in the world, with an average annual PM2.5 level of 97.1 μg/m3 (6.5 times higher than the WHO standard). In 2024, Bangladesh was identified as the leading country worldwide for the highest AQI levels, with Dhaka experiencing good air quality for only 13 days out of 365. For the remaining days, the AQI levels consistently fell within high categories. The Air Quality Monthly Report for January 2025, released by the Department of Environment (DoE), Bangladesh, classified 24 of the 31 days in January as ‘very unhealthy’ or ‘extremely unhealthy’. The distribution of air pollutants in terms of space and time plays a crucial role in identifying potential sources of pollution and monitoring changes in air quality levels.

**A notable increase in the annual average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (1.72%), SO<sub>2</sub> (38.58%), CO (6.86%), and O<sub>3</sub> (5.44%), while NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations experienced a decline (13.71%), with overall pollutant levels peaking in winter.**
**The levels of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> , and CO during the lockdown period from March to May 2020 decreased by 42.59%, 7.12%, and 2.50%, respectively, compared to the period before the lockdown (December- 
2019-February 2020).**
