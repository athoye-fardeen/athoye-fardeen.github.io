### *Problem Statement*
*Rapid urbanization has intensified the dual challenges of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and air pollution in cities. While significant research has focused on the spatial and temporal characteristics of air pollution and UHI, the spatially heterogeneous relationship between them remains underexplored. In 2018, Dhaka city was ranked among the nine largest urban agglomerations in the world, and it is projected to become the fourth largest by 2030. The city faces challenges related to high population density, unplanned urban growth, and considerable traffic congestion within a limited land area. UHI effects and air pollution have emerged as critical concerns for the city. The municipal unit serves as the fundamental framework for urban development, effective land use planning, and the provision of public amenities. This research examined how underlying air pollutants influence the characteristics of the UHI phenomenon across 93 wards (municipal units) in Dhaka from 2019 to 2022.* 

### *Research Questions*
- *Do air pollutants have the same influence on UHI intensity across different areas of a city, or do their impacts vary spatially?*
- *Can global regression methods, such as OLS, effectively capture localized variations in air pollution, or are more specific local models more appropriate?*
- *If spatial heterogeneity is present, should environmental and urban planning policies remain standardized throughout a city, or should they be adapted to reflect local conditions?*
